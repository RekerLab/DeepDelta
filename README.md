## Overview

DeepDelta is a pairwise deep learning approach that processes two molecules simultaneously and learns to predict property differences between two molecules. The technical novelty of DeepDelta is the transformation of a classically single-molecule task (ADMET property prediction of molecules) into a dual molecule task by pairing molecules. This transformation creates a novel regression task with quadratically increased amount of data. This regression task can be solved with any established molecular machine learning pipeline. We have evaluated several established models, including [LightGBM](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/lightgbm/) and the two-molecule version of [Chemprop](https://github.com/chemprop/chemprop), and found strong performance and notable improvements over using these and other models (e.g., [Random Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html)) in the classic, single molecule mode to predict ADMET properties. 

The final and best performing version of DeepDelta creates the molecular pairing and then simply uses the previously [published](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01250) and extensively validated two-molecule version of Chemprop, which has been developed by the group of [Professor William H. Green (MIT)](https://greengroup.mit.edu/) and the [Chemprop team](https://chemprop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for various two-molecule tasks such as [solubility of solute - solvent pairs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385894721008925). We are grateful to the Chemprop community for making their code open source and providing feedback on the work, without which this work could not have been conducted. Although the figures and tables in the manuscript describe models as "Chemprop" and "DeepDelta", both use the underlying Chemprop D-MPNN architecture and the difference is the training data - whether Chemprop is applied to ADMET prediction through single-molecule processing as established and published by others for these type of tasks (e.g., [ref1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.28.573531v1), [ref2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00245), [ref3](https://www.future-science.com/doi/full/10.4155/fmc-2020-0259)) or whether it is used by following the "DeepDelta molecular pairing" approach for training data creation. Given the improved performance of two molecule Chemprop when using paired data compared to single molecule Chemprop, we hope this result can be informative for the future deployment of Chemprop on small datasets and for the continuos development of molecular machine learning approaches.

**Figure 1: Traditional and Pairwise Architectures. (A)** Traditional molecular machine learning models take singular molecular inputs and predict absolute properties of molecules. Predicted property differences can be calculated by subtracting predicted values for two molecules. **(B)** Pairwise models train on differences in properties from pairs of molecules to directly predict property changes of molecular derivatizations. **(C)** Molecules are cross-merged to create pairs only after cross-validation splits to prevent the risk of data leakage during model evaluation. Through this, every molecule in the dataset can only occur in pairs in the training or testing data but not both.

On 10 pharmacokinetic benchmark tasks, our DeepDelta pairing approach using two molecule Chemprop outperforms at predicting ADMET differences between molecules compared to the performance of the single molecule implementation of ChemProp or Random Forest using radial fingerprints, which are considered some of the best models for single molecule ADMET predictions. 

We also derive three simple computational tests of our models based on first mathematical principles and show that compliance to these tests correlate with overall model performance â€“ providing an innovative, unsupervised, and easily computable measure of expected model performance and applicability.

1. With same molecule for both inputs, predictions should be zero:
</p>


```math
DeepDelta(x,x)= 0
```

<br />

<p align="center">
2. With swapped input molecules, predictions should be inversed:
</p>


```math
DeepDelta(x,y)= - DeepDelta(y,x) 
```

<br />

<p align="center">
3. Predicted difference between three molecules should be additive:
</p>

 
```math
DeepDelta(x,y) + DeepDelta(y,z)= DeepDelta(x,z)
```
